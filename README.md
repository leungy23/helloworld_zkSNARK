# helloworld_zkSNARK
My first attempt playing with zkSNARK and circuit writing - intended as use for memory

Quick and simple demo made using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMUj3eFMA24 with the ZOKRATES syntax updated to work with current ZOKRATES library.

Update - i edited it for a age proving identity use case but it doesnt really work as expected, the zkSNARK is fine, and the proof works, but the circuit needs some work/refinement as there is something i am not understanding :)
